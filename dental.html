	<p><mark>Dental Floss is usually considered important to dental professionals and dental patients, but floss can be useful for many things other than the teeth.</mark> Some people use dental floss as a clothes line to dry clothes on, and some people use it to cut cheesecake. Dental floss has been around since the 1800's and Dental professionals consider it to be very important in maintaining good oral hygiene. <mark>Floss helps prevent many diseases such as heart disease, dental carries, gum disease as well as many more, but many people refuse to floss on a daily basis.</mark> Since there are many different types of flosses for people to choose from such as flavored(such as mint or cinnamon), unflavored, waxed and unwaxed floss, everyone should be able to find one that they like the best. People should floss on a daily basis at least one time per day(before brushing), and there is a pretty simple technique for flossing. All you have to do is get a long enough piece of floss that can be wrapped around your first fingers on both hands, and then slide the floss between the interproximal areas of each tooth .<mark> The floss should reach under the gum line of each tooth and then scrape up against each tooth using a C-shape in order to scrape off bacterial plaque.</mark> Flossing can be very beneficial to your health when used properly, but if floss should is used in a rough manner gum tissue damage may occur.

Gingivitis can be prevented if flossing is used consistently on a daily basis because flossing helps removes plaque between the teeth and the gums. In their study, “The Effectiveness of Dental Floss in Reducing Gingival Inflammation,” <mark>Paul Finklestein and Eli Grossman find that “Unwaxed and waxed dental floss were clinically evaluated for effectiveness in reducing gingival inflammation....Both types of floss.... were very effective, but no significant differences between them could be found.</mark>

 This shows that waxed and unwaxed floss are very effective in reducing ginvival infammation(gingivitis) which leads to bone loss. Gingivitis is when the gums are enlarged from irritation from an accumulation of plaque, and it usually leads to tooth loss. Many people can avoid losing their teeth being forced to buy dental prosthetics if they start flossing consistently. <mark id="large">Although Floss is very effective in preventing gingivitis when used consistently, an interdental brush has been found to be more effective in removing plaque from between the teeth.</mark> In their study </p>

<blockquote>
 ”A comparison of proximal plaque removal using floss and interdental brushes,” kiger et. Al says that, “ ...interdental brush used in combination with a toothbrush is more effective in the removal of plaque from proximal tooth surfaces than a toothbrush used alone or in combination with dental floss.” 
</blockquote>
<p>
 This shows that plaque can be removed more efficiently using an interdental brush and a toothbrush compared to flossing and using a toothbrush. This means that if people do not like to floss their teeth to remove plaque, they can use an interdental brush instead.

picture of floss threader Although interdental brushes are effective in preventing gingivitis better than floss, some people must use floss because there needs to be enough room interproximally between teeth to use an interdental brush. Floss is thin, so it is easier to fit between the teeth compared to an interproximal brush. Although flavored waxed dental floss is preferred by many patients, unwaxed dental floss is known to be better for your dental health. In the study “Patient preference for waxed or unwaxed dental floss,” Beaumont says 
<blockquote>
“The purpose of this study was to discover patient preference for waxed or unwaxed dental floss....An unsubstantiated belief in the superiority of unwaxed floss has persisted to the present time.” 
</blockquote>

<p>
This article shows that people believe that unwaxed floss is better for you compared to waxed floss. People prefer waxed floss because it is easier to glide between teeth that are closer together and less harsh on your gums, but unwaxed floss cleans the inter-proximal areas of the teeth and gingiva much better. 
<mark>Even though unwaxed floss tends to break more often than waxed floss, the unwaxed floss removes mucous plaque much better than waxed floss.</mark> Since there are many different types of flosses for people to choose from such as flavored(such as mint or cinnamon), unflavored, waxed and unwaxed floss, everyone should be able to find one that they like the best. Flossing is a non-complicated procedure that can be accomplished in a few minutes, and only has to be done once a day before brushing. <mark>If patients don't want to use floss, they can use an interdental brush to reduce plaque. </mark>Removal of plaque is very beneficial because it can help prevent many oral health problems such as gingivitis and heart disease. People should use unwaxed floss for the best results in removal of plaque.</p>
